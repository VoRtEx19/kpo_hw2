User manual for setting up the app:
1. Open PostgreSQL (version used 42.5.1)
2. Register a server or use an existing one
3. Take a database
4. In resources/application.properties in app insert your own parameters: URL, username, password
5. Launch

NB! Database must not contain tables named Users, Dish, Revenue when you first configure the app, if their signature is different from the intended. Consecutive launching will be alright.

Interface is intuitive.
